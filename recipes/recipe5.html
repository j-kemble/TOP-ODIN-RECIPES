      <h2 class="directions">Directions</h2>
  
      <ol>
        
        <li>
          Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 
          large skillet over medium-high heat. 
          Cook turkey sausages until they 
          begin to brown and firm up, 3 to 4 
          minutes per side. Remove to a cutting 
          board and let cool slightly before 
          cutting into 1/2-inch thick diagonal 
          slices; they will not be completely 
          cooked at this point.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 
          the same skillet over high heat. 
          Quickly stir-fry onion until it begins 
          to brown, about 1 minute. Add peppers
           and continue cooking over high heat, 
           stirring constantly, until peppers 
           begin to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Do not 
           overcrowd the skillet in order to get
            a nice char on vegetables. Mix in 
            garlic and cook for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return sausage, and any accumulated juices, 
          to the skillet. Season with crushed red 
          pepper, salt, and pepper and reduce heat 
          to medium. Stir to combine and continue
           cooking until sausage is no longer pink
           in the center, about 2 minutes more.
        </li>
        
      </ol>
