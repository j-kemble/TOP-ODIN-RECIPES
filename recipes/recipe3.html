      <h2 class="directions">Directions</h2>

      <ol>

        <li>Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>
          Heat olive oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. 
          Add chicken and brown on one side, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip chicken 
          and add onion and garlic; continue to cook until chicken is 
          mostly (but not fully) cooked and onion and garlic are soft, 
          5 to 7 minutes more. Remove chicken to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add honey, soy sauce, onion powder, and garlic powder 
          to the skillet. Stir and scrape the bottom of the pan with a
           wooden spoon to get garlic and onion to mix with the liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return chicken to the skillet, cover, and reduce heat to medium. 
          Cook until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 
          about 10 more minutes, turning once halfway through. An instant-read 
          thermometer inserted into the center of a thigh should read at least 
          165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Arrange chicken on a serving plate and drizzle liquid 
          from the pan on top. Sprinkle with cilantro to serve.</li>

      </ol>
