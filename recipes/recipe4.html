        Garlic butter shrimp features plump, tender
        shrimp sautéed in a rich garlic and butter
        sauce, often finished with fresh herbs and
        lemon. It's a quick and flavorful dish that's
        perfect for pasta, rice, or as a standalone appetizer.

      <h2 class="directions">Directions</h2>

      <ol>

        <li>Place parsley and olive oil into
          a resealable plastic bag. Add shrimp,
          coat with the marinade, squeeze out
          excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate
          in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
          Soak skewers in water during the last 30
          minutes or so.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high
          heat and lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove shrimp from the marinade and
          thread onto skewers. Season generously
          with seasoned salt. Place parsley and
          remaining marinade in a grill-safe pan
          with butter and garlic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grill skewers until shrimp are pink and
          firm, about 3 minutes per side. In the
          meantime, place the grill pan on the
          grate; melt and simmer the butter-parsley
          mixture until butter is just golden-brown,
          4 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove shrimp from skewers and drop 
          into the butter-parsley mixture. Toss 
          to coat. Serve immediately.</li>

      </ol>
